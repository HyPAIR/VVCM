# VVCM

 ROS package for a multi-robot transporting system with a deformable sheet, use virtual variable cables model (**VVCM**) to model the system.

## Usage

Use a stable forward kinematics algorithm to compute the object pose given the robot formation and the deformable sheet:

  ```shell
  $ roslaunch vvcm_fk vvcm_test.launch 
  ```
